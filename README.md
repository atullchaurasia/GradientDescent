## Overview

Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used to minimize a cost function by iteratively moving towards the minimum value of the function. This project visually demonstrates different variants of Gradient Descent, helping you better understand how each algorithm updates the parameters and converges toward the solution.

This repository contains multiple Python scripts, each representing a different variant of Gradient Descent, and provides step-by-step visualizations of how these algorithms operate on simple data.

## Algorithms

### 2D Gradient Descent

- **File**: `2DGradientDescent.py`
- **Description**: 
  - Visualizes the gradient descent process on a simple quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 \).
  - The gradient is calculated using the derivative of the function, and the algorithm iteratively moves towards the minimum.
  - This is a 2D visualization where the red dot represents the current position of the gradient descent.

### 3D Gradient Descent

- **File**: `3DGradientDescent.py`
- **Description**: 
  - Demonstrates gradient descent on a 3D sinusoidal function.
  - Three points are tracked as they converge towards the minimum using gradient updates. 
  - A 3D surface plot is used to show how the algorithm descends from different initial points to the minimum of the function.

### Batch Gradient Descent

- **File**: `BatchGradientDescent.py`
- **Description**: 
  - Implements Batch Gradient Descent for simple linear regression.
  - It computes the gradient using the entire dataset and updates the model parameters at each iteration.
  - The script generates real-time visualizations of the fitted regression line during the learning process.
  
### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

- **File**: `StochasticGradientDescent.py`
- **Description**: 
  - Uses Stochastic Gradient Descent, where the model parameters are updated using a single data point at each step.
  - Due to the stochastic nature, the algorithm oscillates but can converge faster on large datasets.
  - Real-time visualization of the regression line at regular intervals is shown.

### Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

- **File**: `MiniBatchGradientDescent.py`
- **Description**: 
  - Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is a compromise between Batch and Stochastic Gradient Descent.
  - It divides the dataset into small batches and computes the gradient for each mini-batch to update the model parameters.
  - The script visualizes how the regression line evolves after processing each mini-batch.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

### Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gradient-descent-visualization.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gradient-descent-visualization
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

You can run each script independently to visualize the gradient descent algorithms.

1. **2D Gradient Descent:**
   ```bash
   python 2DGradientDescent.py
   ```

2. **3D Gradient Descent:**
   ```bash
   python 3DGradientDescent.py
   ```

3. **Batch Gradient Descent:**
   ```bash
   python BatchGradientDescent.py
   ```

4. **Stochastic Gradient Descent:**
   ```bash
   python StochasticGradientDescent.py
   ```

5. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent:**
   ```bash
   python MiniBatchGradientDescent.py
   ```

## Visualization

Each script provides an interactive plot to help visualize the gradient descent process. For example:
- **2D Gradient Descent** shows the movement of a point along a quadratic curve towards the minimum.
- **3D Gradient Descent** displays the descent of three points on a 3D surface.
- **Batch, Stochastic, and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent** scripts provide real-time updates on the fitting of the regression line.

Here is an example of a 3D Gradient Descent visualization:

## Future Enhancements

- Add more complex datasets and functions to test Gradient Descent.
- Compare the performance (speed, accuracy) of different gradient descent algorithms on real-world datasets.
- Add support for adaptive learning rates (e.g., AdaGrad, RMSProp, Adam).
